      question: "How does NotaBeen handle my professional email data?",
      answer:
        "NotaBeen offers two options. The open-source version is fully self-hosted, meaning your email data stays on your own private server and never touches our systems. For our hosted version, your data is processed in a secure, private cloud environment that adheres to strict privacy standards and is never sold or used for AI training.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI assistant actually save me time?",
      answer:
        "NotaBeen's AI works to eliminate inbox anxiety by automatically sorting, prioritizing, and summarizing your emails. It cuts through low-value messages, ensuring that your most important communications are always easy to find, so you can spend less time sifting through clutter.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is NotaBeen difficult to set up?",
      answer:
        "For the self-hosted, open-source version, the process involves a quick setup on your private server, with step-by-step documentation to guide you. If you'd prefer an effortless experience, our hosted version requires no setup at allâ€”just a simple sign-in and connection to your email.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the costs associated with using NotaBeen?",
      answer:
        "The NotaBeen software is fully open-source and free to use. The only cost for the open-source version is for hosting the assistant on your private server, which is typically a minimal fee. We also offer a paid hosted version, which includes our managed cloud service for a simple, one-time fee for lifetime usage.",
